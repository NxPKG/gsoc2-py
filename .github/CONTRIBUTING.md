Start by cloning the repository:
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/gsoc2/gsoc2-py
$ cd gsoc2-py
```

We recommand that you create a virtual environment:
```console
$ python -m venv env
```

Then activate the environment with:
```console
# For linux
$ source ./env/bin/activate

# For Windows PowerShell
$ .\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Make sure that you have the latest version of `pip` to avoid errors on the next step:
```console
$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Then install the project in editable mode and the dependencies with:
```console
$ pip install -e '.[dev,test]'
```

To run all the tests you can use the following command:
```console
$ pytest tests
```
